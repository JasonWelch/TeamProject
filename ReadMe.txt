     Rental Car Read Me
     
       The goal of this project was to create a simple car rental program that would allow renters to be associated with small cars or big cars. This would allow us to provide an interface in which users would be able to enter the renter and car information and be able to provide data on those back through the user interface.
       Our user interface provides a simple graphical interface that allows users to enter the following information:
       	Renter’s Name- Can be entered as a string value
       	Renter’s ID- Can be entered as mixed alphanumeric characters
       	Renter’s Address- Can be entered as mixed alphanumeric characters
       	Car ID- Can be entered as an int value
       	Car Make- Can be entered as a string value
       	Car Model- Can be entered as a string value
       	Car Year- Can be entered as an int value
       	Car Price- Can be entered as an int value
       	Car Type- Can be entered as big or small
	We also provide predefined functions attached to buttons that allow users easy access to more complex functions. We provided buttons that allow for the following functions:
		Reserve Small Car
		Reserve Big Car
		Return Car
		Display Rental Info
	Reserve small car will allow a user to attach their information to a car of type small. Reserve big car will allow users to attach their information to a car of type big. Return car will remove their user information from being attached to any specific vehicle. Display rental information will show current renter information and they cars that they have currently rented.   
	We have included classes for the individual renting, small cars and large cars to accommodate the information in a manor that is both easy to view and interpret. This program functions as designed and lets a user open the graphical user interface to add or remove information based on their needs at the time of access.
